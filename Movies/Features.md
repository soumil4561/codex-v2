These define _what the system should do_.

### 🎬 Movie & Show Management

1. The system shall allow admins to add, update, or delete movies with metadata (title, genre, cast, description, duration, etc.).
2. The system shall allow admins to create and manage recurring or single-time show schedules for each movie.
3. The system shall support multiple theaters, each with one or more screens and different seating layouts.

### 🔍 Movie Discovery & Filtering

4. The system shall allow users to browse and search for movies by title, genre, actor, or director.
5. The system shall allow users to filter movies by date, time, location (city/theater), and availability.

### 🪑 Seat Selection & Reservation

6. The system shall display a visual seating layout for a selected show.
7. The system shall allow users to select one or more available seats.
8. The system shall temporarily lock selected seats during the booking process for a limited time (e.g., 5 minutes).
9. The system shall prevent double booking of seats via transactional integrity.

### 🎟️ Booking & Payments

10. The system shall allow users to confirm their seat selection and proceed to payment.
11. The system shall integrate with an external payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) for handling transactions.
12. The system shall create a booking record upon successful payment.
13. The system shall release seat locks if the user fails to complete the payment within the allowed time.

### 🧑 User Account Management

14. The system shall support user registration and authentication (email/password or social login).
15. The system shall allow users to view their past bookings.
16. The system shall allow users to cancel bookings (within a defined policy window, e.g., 1 hour before the show).

### 🛎️ Notifications

17. The system shall send booking confirmation emails/SMS to the user upon successful payment.
18. The system shall send reminder notifications before the show starts.

### 🌐 Region and Localization Support

19. The system shall support multiple time zones based on user or theater location.
20. The system shall display localized movie names and descriptions based on the user’s preferred language.

### 🛠️ Admin Features

21. The system shall provide an admin dashboard for managing movies, shows, theaters, and seats.
22. The system shall allow admins to view real-time statistics like occupancy, revenue, and seat usage.

# 🚀 Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

These define _how the system should behave_.

### ⚡ Performance

1. The system should support real-time seat availability updates with low latency.
2. The system should be able to handle high traffic (e.g., during blockbuster releases or weekends).

### 🔐 Security

3. All user data and payment details should be securely stored and transmitted (SSL/TLS encryption).
4. The system should implement role-based access control (admin vs user).
5. The system should prevent replay or duplicate booking attacks (idempotency).

### 📈 Scalability

6. The system should be horizontally scalable to support theaters across multiple regions.
7. Services like caching (Redis) and queuing (RabbitMQ/Kafka) should be used for high throughput.

### 💾 Availability & Fault Tolerance

8. The system should ensure high availability (99.9% uptime or more).
9. Seat reservation and payment flows should be resilient to partial failures (e.g., retry mechanisms).

### 🧪 Testability

10. The system should be unit, integration, and load-testable.
11. Test environments should mirror production configurations where possible.

### 🧩 Maintainability

12. The codebase should follow clean architecture practices and be modular for future upgrades.

### 📊 Observability

13. The system should expose logs, metrics, and health checks for monitoring purposes.
