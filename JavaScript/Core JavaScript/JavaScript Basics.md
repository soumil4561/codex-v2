JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. 

*JavaScript is case-sensitive*

**Declarations**
- `var` Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
- `let` Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
- `const` Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.

*You can declare variables to unpack values using the destructuring assignment syntax*. For example, `const { bar } = foo`. This will create a variable named bar and assign to it the value corresponding to the key of the same name from our object foo.

In a statement like let x = 42, the let x part is called a declaration, and the = 42 part is called an initializer. 

In var and let declarations, the initializer is optional. If a variable is declared without an initializer, it is assigned the value `undefined`.
